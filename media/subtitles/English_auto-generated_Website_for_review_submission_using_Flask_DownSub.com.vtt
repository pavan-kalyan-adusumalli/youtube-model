00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.790

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.859
these are all in environment variables

3
00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.580
and we have said all of them now let us

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.150
turn our flask application using flask

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.480
one comment I can show you our flask

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.900
application is running on this IP

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.900
address let us go to the uncross it in

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.070
browser this is the speed the time zone

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.610
so this is your login form so since we

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.750
don't have an account let us create one

11
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.690
since username should have contain at

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.489
least by characters let's just beyond

13
00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:50.489
username 1 2 3 that if this account

14
00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.219
will be created or not since we have

15
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.370
given wrong details

16
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.770
you take them so yes it is not creating

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.850
so let us queue the name is 1 2 3 & 4

18
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.080
so let us again create the since we have

19
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.600
typed wrong password passwords could not

20
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.270
match so it is properly working now let

us give the right passwords here

22
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.930

24
00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.070
